## About Sockeye Salmon

- **Scientific Name:** *Oncorhynchus nerka*  
- **Average Size:** 4–8 lbs (1.8–3.6 kg)  
- **Peak Season:** Mid-June to late July (varies by river)  
- **Flavor Profile:** Rich, firm, and prized for grilling, smoking, and canning  

Sockeye salmon spend most of their lives in the ocean but return to freshwater rivers and lakes to spawn. Unlike other salmon species, sockeye primarily feed on plankton, making traditional lure and bait fishing less effective — which is why **flossing** (also known as lining) is the most common technique.
